###Usage:

- cava.sh "extracts" the Rent folder from your Firefox bookmarks as a human-readable .csv file, commits the file and pushes it upstream
- point it to the Firefox bookmarks file on your local disk and specify a name for the output file:
> *cava.sh /path/to/firefox/bookmarks.sqlite output.csv*

- make sure you have appropriate permissions to push upstream
